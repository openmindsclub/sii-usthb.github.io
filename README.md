### A website for sharing SII Master's materials 

This is a static website generated with a simple python script. 
It is open for anyone to contribute. 


#### Why the generator? 
Because other static web generators are too complex for the needs of the project. (pip install -r requirements.txt)
It's really easy, you can even ignore everything and only check the *Data/* folder for modifications. 

### The project structure:

It's really simple:

* *generate.py*: One python program to generate the website using [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) templating. 
* *template/*: contains the Jinja2 templates.
* *Data/*: contains the zip files.
