### How to contribute to **FOS Jump** ?

Anyone can add:

* Other FOS Projects with **good how-to-contribute readings**;
* Website that help finding projects FOS Projects to participate to;
* Videos about the subject;
* Or propose any other idea for improving this platform.

There are three main ways to proceed:

1. Making a pull request to the [github project](https://github.com/fosjump/fosjump).
2. Via github issues: 
    * Adding links by commenting to [newProjectLink issue](https://github.com/fosjump/fosjump/issues/2) or [otherLinks issue](https://github.com/fosjump/fosjump/issues/1)
    * Modifying or proposing something else by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/fosjump/fosjump/issues)
3. Or sending an email to **fosjump@tutanota.com** (if you don't have a github account)


Due to it's simplicity, this project can be a nice first-pull-request-experiance for those who want to try!


**IMPORTANT**: Only links to FOS projects that are new-commers-friendly are accepted in [the main list](index.html). 

Any type of contribution is welcomed.
